# isPredator
I was interested in using a random forest (ensemble learning) to compare against a neural network to classify an animal as a predator or non-predator using the “zoo” dataset from UCI Machine Learning. The learning.py and utils.py files are modified from the AIMA python package: https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python.


## How to run classification algorithms

### Find the accuracy of multiple random forests

$ python predator.py

This will prompt for 4 paramaters
- forest_size: number of forests 
- tree_size: number of animals in the tree (between 1 and 101, where 101 is the size of “zoo” dataset)
- test_data_size: percent of data used in training set (the rest is used in test set)
- reps: number of times a forest is generated

### Find accuracy of neural network for multiple neural networks.


$python predatorNetting.py


This will prompt for 3 parameters:
- Proportion of entries in training set (number between 0 and 1)
- Number of times neural network is generated
- Number of nodes in hidden layer


## Comparing neural network against random forest

### Plot 3D graph for random forest trials
In order to get the 3D plot that can be manipulated, you have to run plotPredator as such:


$ python plotPredator.py [.csv filename] [graph dimension]


To use the existing .csv file to plot results of random forests, type in:


$ python plotPredator.py 100reps.csv 3


Note: random_forest_plot.png is a graph that was generated from 100reps.csv.

### Plot 2D graph generated by neural network
The 2D plot generated by the neural network can be run as such:


$ python plotPredator.py [.csv filename] [graph dimension]


To use the existing .csv file to plot results of neural network type in:


$ python plotPredator.py 20repsNetting.csv 2


Note: neural_net_plot.png is an example of a plot generated by 20repsNetting.csv
