# isPredator
I was interested in using a random forest (ensemble learning) and compare it against a neural network to classify if an animal is a predator. I used the “zoo” dataset from UCI Machine Learning. 


## How to run random forest

### Find the accuracy of multiple random forests

$ python predator.py

This will prompt for 4 paramaters
- forest_size: number of forests 
- tree_size: number of animals in the tree (between 1 and 101, where 101 is the size of “zoo” dataset)
- test_data_size: percent of data used in training set (the rest is used in test set)
- reps: number of times a forest is generated

## Comparing neural network against random forest

## Find accuracy of neural network for multiple neural networks.

$python predatorNetting.py

This will prompt for 3 parameters:
- Proportion of entries in training set (number between 0 and 1)
- Number of times neural network is generated
- Number of nodes in hidden layer

### Plot 3D graph for random forest trials
In order to get the 3D plot that can be manipulated, you have to run plotPredator as such:

$ python plotPredator.py 100reps.csv 3

this plots the result of the random forest.

Note: random_forest_plot.png is a graph that was generated this way.

### Plot  2D graph generated by neural network
The plot generated by the neural network can be run as such:

$ python plotPredator.py 20repsNetting.csv 2

Note: neural_net_plot.png is an example of a plot generated by this.
